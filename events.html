                        planned. From educational workshops and panels to networking events and demonstrations, we have something for 
                        everyone who is interested in VR.

                        If you are a VR developer, designer, researcher, or just someone who is curious about the technology, we 
                        encourage you to join us at one of our events. You'll have the opportunity to learn from experts in the field,
